†In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

**The first of the Joyful Mysteries, the Annunciation**

> _The angel of the Lord declared unto Mary, and she conceived of the Holy Spirit... "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it done unto me according to thy word."_

Lord, please grant us a share in Mary's humility, that we may accept with faith and joy Your plan for our lives and choose to live in cooperation with Your divine will. Help us to trust in You, to say 'yes' as Mary did. Amen.

**The second of the Joyful Mysteries, the Visitation**

> _Mary went to live with her cousin Elizabeth for the duration of their pregnancies. The infant John leapt for joy in Elizabeth's womb at the approach of the Lord Jesus, and Elizabeth exclaimed "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb! How is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"_

Lord, grant us a share in Mary's filial piety, and help us also to appreciate the holy participation that motherhood is in Your divine work, the creation of life. Amen.

**The third of the Joyful Mysteries, the Nativity**

> _"And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us..."_

Lord, You so humbled yourself to be born in a manger, among animals, to a poor travelling couple. You have sanctified even infancy, sharing in the experience of every newborn child. Let us always rejoice at this great mystery. Thank You Lord for the great gift of Yourself in the flesh. Amen.

**The fourth of the Joyful Mysteries, the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple**

> _On the eighth day, in accordance with the Mosaic law, Joseph and Mary presented the baby Jesus in the temple, consecrating Him to the Lord._

Lord, grant us a share in the piety and obedience of Joseph and Mary, by which they humbly partook in the return of Your holy presence to the Temple at Jerusalem. Let us always turn to You, the source and end of all that is good, and offer to You our first fruits, in times of both plenty and need. In so doing, may the temple of our bodies also be sanctified, and help us to live according to your commandments. Amen.

**The fifth of the Joyful Mysteries, the Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple**

> _After searching for Him for three days, Joseph and Mary found the child Jesus in the Temple, listening to the teachers and asking them questions._

Lord, grant that we may always see your face in the children under our care as teachers and parents. Grant us patience, and that we may always love and care for them as You Yourself do. Amen.

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.†

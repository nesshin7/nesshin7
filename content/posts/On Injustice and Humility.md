> **"For one is approved if, mindful of God, he endures pain while suffering unjustly. For what credit is it, if when you do wrong and are beaten for it you take it patiently? But if when you do right and suffer for it you take it patiently, you have God’s approval. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. He committed no sin; no guile was found on his lips. When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he trusted to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls."** 
--1 Peter 2:19-25 (RSVCE)

Perhaps it should go without saying that there is no credit in suffering the consequences of our sins; but to suffer for good, in union with Christ and in harmony with the Divine Will, is salvific.

Without the grace of God, when we suffer injustice - great or small - we often experience frustration, indignation, or even despair. We are frustrated when we put our will to action and are met with resistance or failure. We experience indignation when our character is challenged or our righteous actions or thoughts (true or otherwise) are contradicted. When we are repeatedly overpowered by evil, we begin to despair - because we are relying on our own power. We wish for our will to become reality, but ultimately, our power is insufficient and our will is impotent. I suspect a lot of the negative emotion we experience in these situtations is fueled by pride, and could be mitigated by humility.

Sometimes, we even even feel a perverse pleasure in indignation, seeking to be justified in our own esteem. We can even find ourselves addicted to the sense of self righteousness found in conflict and victimhood.

Other times, in our timidity and hate for discomfort, we might shy away from saying or doing what is good and true, and give way to evil. We may surrender to cowardice under the illusion of kindness and diplomacy.

> **"Do nothing from selfishness or conceit, but in humility count others better than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which was in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."**
--Philippians 2:3-11 (RSVCE)

Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, Lord of the universe, submitted himself to ridicule, torture, and execution. The Logos, God - suffered the most unjust humiliation, crowned with thorns in a mockery of his lordship, the extent of his true authority and dignity beyond even the imaginations of his tormentors. But in his perfect meekness and humility, he was justified and then glorified. We too have the promise of justification and glorification, not on our own power but through faith in Jesus Christ.

> **Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple robe; they came up to him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and struck him with their hands.** 
--John 19:1-3 (RSVCE)

If we can remember the face of Jesus crowned with thorns, then even in times of unjust opposition or humiliation we have an opportunity to find peace in the knowledge that God Himself has endured such indignity. Instead of falling into the grip of frustration or even despair, let's ask God for a share in the patient endurance and perfect humility of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
